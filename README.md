# Financial-Markets
This involves portfolio analysis, regulatory discussions post-financial scandals, and comparative analysis of financial products, respectively, providing comprehensive insights into investment strategies, regulatory frameworks, and product comparisons.

The project has been divided into 3 categories:
1. Investment Portfolio Analysis
Overview: It involves analyzing five investment options – bonds, income stocks, cryptocurrencies, equity ETFs, and cryptocurrency ETFs – to determine optimal portfolio allocations for an investment company. Tasks included individual analysis of portfolios, comparison of risk and return metrics, and collaborative decision-making to select suitable investments.

2. Regulation and Financial Scandals Discussion
It is focused on exploring the implications of proposed regulations following a financial scandal, specifically the FTX crisis. The project entailed conducting a panel discussion through a transcripted interview, with roles assigned to team members as technical and non-technical interviewees and a journalist. Topics included regulation motivations, foundations, risks, and comparisons to historical scandals.

3. Comparative Analysis of Financial Products
It involves comparing mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and indexed annuities. Teams prepared overviews of each product type, addressing features, benefits, and associated risks. Additionally, team members assumed roles representing each product type and analyzed specific risks and regulatory aspects. The project provided insights into the characteristics and suitability of different investment vehicles.
